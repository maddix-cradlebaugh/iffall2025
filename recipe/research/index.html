        <h1><i>Marry Me Tofu</i></h1>
        <h2>By Anna Painter</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Marry Me Tofu is a rich, flavorful dish featuring golden pan-seared tofu simmered in a creamy sun-dried tomato and garlic-infused sauce. With a balance of savory, tangy, and slightly spicy notes, it's a comforting and satisfying plant-based main that pairs well with pasta, rice, or crusty bread.</p>

                Instructions
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Drain tofu, then cut block in half crosswise. Cut each half into 1" pieces. Poke each piece with a fork. Arrange in a 9" x 9" baking dish in a single layer.</li>
                <li>Peel and smash 2 garlic cloves and transfer to a small saucepan. Add water, 2 Tbsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. oregano, and 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and bring to a boil over high heat. Pour brine over tofu. Let sit 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Working one or two at a time, remove tofu from brine and pat dry on all sides with more paper towels. Arrange on prepared sheet. Cover with more paper towels or another clean kitchen towel and lightly pat dry again (do not apply too much pressure).</li>
                <li>In a shallow bowl, combine cornstarch, onion powder, paprika, 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt. Transfer tofu to bowl and gently toss to coat in cornstarch mixture. Discard paper towels. Set a wire rack over same baking sheet.</li>
                <li>In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add tofu and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to prepared rack; season with salt. Wipe out skillet.</li>
                <li>Finely chop remaining 2 garlic cloves. In same skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add chopped garlic and remaining 1/4 tsp. oregano and pinch of red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until paste is brick-red, about 30 seconds more. Add cream, tomatoes, and Parmesan. Cook, stirring, until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes</li>
                <li>Add tofu and basil to skillet and cook, stirring, until warmed through, about 30 seconds; season with salt and black pepper. Add more cream, 1 Tbsp. at a time, if sauce is too thick. Top with more basil and Parmesan.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/280025/grandma-pizza/'">All Recipes</a> is a good recipe website because it very clearly presents the information. The intruction step numbers are bolded, and each step is usually accompanied by an image as a visual aid. It also organzes the recipe with the cook time first, followed by the ingredients, and finally, the instructions.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.acozykitchen.com/">A Cozy Kitchen</a> is another good recipe website because it includes is a list—on the top of each recipe page—of links that allow the reader to skip to whichever part of the page they are interested in. Additionally, the ingredients are bolded, making them easier to read, and each recipe is accompanied by an image depicting all of the necessary ingredients.</li>
                <li><a href="https://food52.com/">Food52</a> may not include the same kind of imagery as the first two sites listed, but it is much less clunky. This makes for an easiery reading experience because the viewer does not need to sift through as much extra content to follow the recipe.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://theoutline.com/">The Outline</a> has a great balance between engaging design and readability. The header of each article contains a large image/design with bold typography and sometimes a small animation. Below that, the article itself is far less busy. This makes for an interesting and easy reading experience. </li>
                <li><a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/">AIGA Eye on Design</a> is incredibly well-designed. From the organization of the home page to the pacing of the article pages, navigating Eye on Design is engaging and straight-foward. I particularly enjoy that the articles have a good mix of body copy, pull quotes, and images.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.guggenheim.org">Guggenheim</a> has a simple, clear website that is easy to navigate but not boring. I appreciate that each page feels cohesive with the rest of the site. The exhibition pages include a large header image or video that captures the viewers eye, but the rest of the page contains more breathing room. </li>
