        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p><b>1.</b> I'm Maddix Cradlebaugh a senior majoring in Communication Design.</p>
        <p><b>2.</b> I'm on the BFA track and this course is required for my degree. I am excited to get some experience with HTML and CSS because it will help expand my skill set.</p>
        <p><b>3.</b> I have very limited experience with HTML. In my Type I class, we used it to adjust the line breaks in a text as the screen size was adjusted.</p>
        <p><b>4.</b> I hope to know some of the coding basics to help me as I build my portfolio site.</p>
        <p><b>5.</b> I expect designing for the screen will differ from designing for paper because of the variety of screen sizes that the design will show on. With paper, there are specific sizes that we design for, so I expect the variability of sizes to be a new challenge.</p>
        <p><b>6.</b> An example of a website with effective design is the <a href="https://www.newbalance.com/"> New Balance</a> website because it is organized, easy to navigate, and visually cohesive.</p>
        <p><b>7.</b> A website with effective communication is the <a href="https://fairvote.org/"> FairVote</a> website because it clearly presents the organization's mission and values while educating viewers on the benefits of ranked choice voting.</p>
        <p><b>8.</b> An example of a website that works well is <a href=layrid.tomoyaokada.com.> layrid.tomoyaokada.com</a>. It is a commemorative website of 100 works by artist Tomoya Okada, who sepcializes in frontend engineering and animation. The transitions between the sections of pages is beautiful as the images morph into each other. The works are clearly organized, which makes for an easy viewing experience as well.</p>
