                <p>Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon<br>In a straight back chair on two legs leaned against the wall<br>Watch the kids a-playin' with June bugs on a string<br>And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall</p>
                <p>In my Tennessee mountain home<br>Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh<br>In my Tennessee mountain home<br>Crickets are singing in the fields near by</p>
                <p>Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane<br>Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet<br>And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads its wings<br>And a songbird on a fence post sings a melody</p>
                <p>In my Tennessee mountain home<br>Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh<br>In my Tennessee mountain home<br>Crickets are singing in the fields near by</p>
                <p>Walkin' home from church on Sunday with the one ya love<br>Just laughin', talkin', making future plans<br>And when you see the folks ain't lookin<br>You might steal a kiss or two<br>Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands</p><p>In my Tennessee mountain home<br>Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh<br>In my Tennessee mountain home<br></p>
